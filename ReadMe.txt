To execute the game you need to install nodejs.
After that in the folder directory command line you need to type "npm install" , then "npm start" to start the server.
Open 2 tabs 
 localhost/(serverPort)/#init      to start the initiator and the other tab 
localhost/(serverPort)                   for the other peer.
Wait for the initiator to get  the  generated id   then copy and paste each other ids to make the connections.
HAVE FUN!!
